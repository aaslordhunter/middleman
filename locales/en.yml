    About Me
  about_description:
    Hi, my name is Ali Aas. My last name is Norweigian for "hill" and is pronounced "Oz", like the wizard. 
    I got my start in the design industry back in 2006 when I built my first website using Dreamweaver and lots 
    of tables. Eight years later, after a design degree and a short relationship with Wordpress, 
    I've found serenity working with Ruby on Rails in the startup space. Outside of work, I am passionate about 
    dachshunds, New England, and Peggy Olson.

    LevelUp Business Site
  project_business_site_description:
    The previous iteration of the LevelUp Business Site was clunky and disjointed. It used three pages
    to explain the product, which resulted in the confusion of potential merchants. In order to create 
    a more digestible experience, the Business Site was condensed into one single
    scroll navigation page, with ease of accesibilty through the inclusion of a sticky highlighting navbar
    and through the color coding of each section.

  project_icon_set_title:
    LevelUp Icon Set
  project_icon_set_description:
    Before building this icon set, the LevelUp design team had no standards for icon size and style.
    Each designer would build a one-off set for each application, which resulted in a muddled
    aesthetic site-wide. Conversely, the new icon set provides continuity by establishing guiding principles
    and by accentuating the simplicity of the brand identity through the use of geometric shapes and lines.

  project_self_enrollment_title:
    LevelUp Self-Enrollment Site
  project_self_enrollment_description:
    In order to on-board businesses faster, LevelUp plans to build a Self-Enrollment "Wizard" that
    allows potential merchants to apply on their own. The intention for the layout of this page is to closly match the design of the Merchant Dashboard,
    so the merchants who are converted are already familiar with the UI. Additionally, the sections
    do not need to be completed in order, so the navigation hints at a progression through the change in
    color, but does not attempt to force the user through a linear path.
