    About Me
  about_description:
    Hi, my name is Ali Aas. My last name means "hill" in Norweigian and is pronounced "Oz", like the wizard. 
    I got my start in the design industry back in 2006 when I built my first website using Dreamweaver and lots 
    of tables. Eight years later, after a design degree and a short relationship with Wordpress, 
    I've found serenity working with Ruby on Rails in the Boston startup space. Outside of work, I enjoy 
    dachshunds, New England, Mad Men, and cooking.

    LevelUp Business
  project_business_site_description:
    The previous iteration of the LevelUp Business Site was clunky and disjointed because
    the information was spread across 4 different pages. In order to create 
    a more digestible experience, the Business Site was condensed into one single
    scroll navigation page, with ease of accesibilty through the use of color coded sections and iconography.

    LevelUp Iconography
  project_icon_set_description:
    Before building this icon set, the LevelUp design team had no standards for icon size and style.
    Each designer would build a one-off set for each application, which resulted in a muddled
    aesthetic site-wide. The new icon set provides continuity by establishing guiding principles
    and by accentuating the simplicity of the brand identity through the use of geometric shapes and lines.

  project_self_enrollment_title:
    LevelUp Self-Enrollment
  project_self_enrollment_description:
    In order to on-board businesses faster, LevelUp plans to build a Self-Enrollment "Wizard". The sections of the "wizard"
    can be filled out in any order and timeframe, so the sidebar alludes to
    a progression bar while not forcing the user down a linear path. Additionally, the layout matches the
    layout for the Merchant Dashboard, so approved merchants can easily transition from one experience to the next.
