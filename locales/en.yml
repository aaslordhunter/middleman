    About Me
  about_description:
    Hi, my name is Ali Aas. My last name means "hill" in Norweigian and is pronounced "Oz", like the wizard.
    I got my start in the design industry back in 2006 when I built my first website using Dreamweaver and lots
    of tables. Eight years later, after a design degree and a short relationship with Wordpress,
    I've found serenity working with Ruby on Rails in the Boston startup space. Outside of work, I enjoy
    dachshunds, New England, Mad Men, and cooking.

  project_business_site_title:
    LevelUp Business
  project_business_site_description:
    The previous iteration of the LevelUp Business Site was clunky and disjointed because
    the information was spread across 4 different pages. In order to create
    a more digestible experience, the Business Site was condensed into one single
    scroll navigation page, with ease of accesibilty through the use of color coded sections and iconography.

  project_campaign_builder_title:
    LevelUp Campaign Builder
  project_campaign_builder_description:
    The goal of the Campaign Builder is to make it easy for merchants to create functional
    campaigns without the support of a LevelUp team member. Accesibilty is achieved through
    the use of a preview screen, which updates each time the merchant changes a value. These
    changes are further accentuated by a focus circle which shows where the content will
    go. Additionally, the use of hints along the side helps to further hand-hold the
    merchant, so they feel safe finalizing the transaction.

  project_campaign_claim_title:
    LevelUp Campaign Claim
  project_campaign_claim_description:
    Campaigns are the advertising platform of the LevelUp network. Merchants use various
    types of campaigns to drive customers to their business. The campaign claim page is
    one location where a user can claim the campaign offered by a merchant. When this page
    was created, LevelUp had a heavy push to engage users via Facebook, so the "Claim with Facebook"
    button dominates the page.

  project_campaigns_page_title:
    LevelUp Campaigns Page
  project_campaigns_page_description:
    Campaigns can be a vague product because merchants have trouble visualizing how the user
    interacts with them. The Campaigns Page alleviates some of that confusion by featuring
    every campaign offered. A merchant can visit the page and click on any campaign to see
    a preview of what it looks like and how it is delivered as well as read a quick summary
    of how it works. The page features a sticky preview section, so the list of campaigns
    is able to grow without breaking the layout of the page.

  project_interstitials_title:
    LevelUp Interstitial Management
  project_interstitials_description:
    Interstitials appear after the user completes an order, but before their in-app receipt
    is shown. The purpose of interstitials is to further engage the user beyond their transaction.
    An example of an interstitial would be a feedback form, which asks a user to rate the experience
    they just had at the merchant. Engaging the user at this moment keeps them in the app longer
    and therefore gives the merchant more time to make an impression on their customer.

  project_icon_set_title:
    LevelUp Iconography
  project_icon_set_description:
    Before building this icon set, the LevelUp design team had no standards for icon size and style.
    Each designer would build a one-off set for each application, which resulted in a muddled
    aesthetic site-wide. The new icon set provides continuity by establishing guiding principles
    and by accentuating the simplicity of the brand identity through the use of geometric shapes and lines.

  project_self_enrollment_title:
    LevelUp Self-Enrollment
  project_self_enrollment_description:
    In order to on-board businesses faster, LevelUp plans to build a Self-Enrollment "Wizard". The sections of the "wizard"
    can be filled out in any order and timeframe, so the sidebar alludes to
    a progression bar while not forcing the user down a linear path. Additionally, the layout matches the
    layout for the Merchant Dashboard, so approved merchants can easily transition from one experience to the next.
